    <reviewtitle>Great game, anyone who loses to Mario has a skill issue</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>This game made my childhood, and I remember playing it on one of the School Computers all the time. I was a really smart kid too, so after about 10 games against Mario in most games (not go fish, that depends on RNG) I started to win almost every time. And yes, I was only able to play it a bunch because I had special privileges due to being Special Ed. for my Autism and ADHD, along with a few other things. Our school was (and still IS to this day) very supportive of Special Ed. students due to the high abundance of them. 10/10 rating from me for special childhood memories.</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>How is this a bad mario game</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Everyone probably shat on this masterpiece for being labeled as "educational". 
Whoever tagged it as such, you had one job.</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>RIGGED</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>I like this game but it cheats for Mario to win. I was playing Yacht and Mario rolled a Yahtzee of all 6's on the FIRST ROLL. Absolute BS!!</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Mario's gonna put theese on the FULL HOUSE line.</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>It's fun gambling with Mario, espicaly when he gets a full house on the second move

Oh and also i got a yacht on the first move, on the first roll once.

Very fun.</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>So happy to see this available online!</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>I played this game A LOT when I was a tot. I'm so happy to be able to pull it up and play checkers or dominos for a quick break. Makes me happy to hear Mario say he's enjoying playing with me; I'd forgotten the game did that.</reviewbody>
